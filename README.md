# Assignment 1

This program reads in an employee file that contains employee last names, first names, middle intitials, ids, and phone numbers. The program takes the file and standardizes the information by making the names capitalized and by making sure that phone numbers and ids are in the correct format.
You can run this program by including an input file as the sysarg. 
Python has many strengths when it comes to text processing. One example is that less code is needed for this task than other languages such as C++ and Java. Another strength is that the syntax is very clear and is easy to reread when looking back. One main weakness though is the fact that Python is comparitively very slow at runtime and execution.
This assignment was mainly review for me. This doesn't mean that it wasn't helpful for me though. For example, this assignment served as a really good review of how regex works with Python.
