# NLP-Portfolio
This is a portfolio that will contain the work that I do in CS 4395 (Human Language Technologies).

# Assignment 0

This assignment was about setting up the portfolio and getting an overview of NLP.

You can see the [assignment deliverable here](https://github.com/srp0223/NLP-Portfolio/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment%200/Overview_of_NLP.pdf).

# Assignment 1

This program reads in an employee file that contains employee last names, first names, middle intitials, ids, and phone numbers. The program takes the file and standardizes the information by making the names capitalized and by making sure that phone numbers and ids are in the correct format.
You can run this program by including an input file as the sysarg. 
Python has many strengths when it comes to text processing. One example is that less code is needed for this task than other languages such as C++ and Java. Another strength is that the syntax is very clear and is easy to reread when looking back. One main weakness though is the fact that Python is comparitively very slow at runtime and execution.
This assignment was mainly review for me. This doesn't mean that it wasn't helpful for me though. For example, this assignment served as a really good review of how regex works with Python.

You can see the [program here](https://github.com/srp0223/NLP-Portfolio/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment%201/Homework1_srp180014.py).

# Assignment 2

This program uses Python and NLTK to explore and tokenize an input text file. The 50 most common words from this input file are then used to create an interactive word guessing game.

You can see the [word guessing game here](https://github.com/srp0223/NLP-Portfolio/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment%202/Homework2_srp180014.py).

# Assignment 3

This assignment provides an overview of the various capabilities of the WordNet and SentiWordNet. In addition, it includes an introduction to collocations.

# Assignment 4

The programs in this assignment build a language model from n-grams. The report is a reflection on the utility of n-gram language models and n-grams in general.

You can see the [first program here](https://github.com/srp0223/NLP-Portfolio/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment%204/Homework4_Program1_srp180014.py).

You can see the [second program here](https://github.com/srp0223/NLP-Portfolio/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment%204/Homework4_Program2_srp180014.py).

# Assignment 5

This assignment covers concepts related to sentence syntax. It covers 3 types of sentence parses: PSG tree, dependency parse, and SRL parse.

# Assignment 6

The purpose of this assignment was to understand how websites work and create a web crawler. The information gathered using this process was used to create a knowledge base.

You can see the [program here](https://github.com/srp0223/NLP-Portfolio/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment%206/Homework6_srp180014.py) and the [report here](https://github.com/srp0223/NLP-Portfolio/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment%206/Homework6Report_srp180014.pdf).

# Assignment 7

The purpose of this assignment was to summarize and reflect on one of the ACL papers provided by the instructor. I chose a paper about unsupervised text style transfer.

You can see the [ACL paper summary here](https://github.com/srp0223/NLP-Portfolio/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment%207/sample).

# Assignment 8

The purpose of this assignment was to create a chatbot using NLP techniques that we learned in class.

You can see the [chatbot here](https://github.com/srp0223/NLP-Portfolio/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment%208/Chatbot.py).

# Skills Learned
This page lists the technical and soft skills that are included in this portfolio.

You can see the [skills learned here](https://github.com/srp0223/NLP-Portfolio/blob/main/Skills%20Learned/Skills%20Learned).

# Summary
This page includes a summary of what I've learned in class and what I plan to do with NLP in the future.
